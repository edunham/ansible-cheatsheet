Ansible Boilerplate/Cheatsheet

My Ansible skills are currently at an awkward intermediate level where I can
happily update configurations, but have to constantly refer back to my
previous work when writing a new playbook from scratch. This repo is a
"learning by teaching" exercise to help me memorize the Ansible-ese name for
each bit of my friendly local command line tools.
